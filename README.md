<h2 align="center"><b>Test-Driven Development with FastAPI and Docker</b></h2>

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://github.com/DanNduati/Jokes_api)

## <b>Description</b>
The JokesAPI is a test-driven development project. This is me learning how to develop and test an asynchronous API built with FastAPI, Postgres, pytest and Docker.

## <b>Prerequisites</b>
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Docker and Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (optional)

## <b>Setup</b>
### <b>Docker</b>
#### Build image and run container
Build the image and fire up the container in detached mode
```bash
$ docker compose up -d --build
```
#### Check logs for the `web` service
```bash
$ docker compose logs web
```
#### Run aerich migration
```bash
$ docker compose exec web aerich upgrade
```

#### Run the tests
```bash
$ docker compose exec web python -m pytest -v
```
#### Test it out with curl or [HTTPie](https://httpie.org/):
```bash
$ http --format-options json.sort_keys:false --pretty=all get http://0.0.0.0:6969/jokes/
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
