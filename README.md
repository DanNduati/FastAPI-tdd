### <b> 2. Getting Jokes </b>
This endpoint is the one you want to call to get joke(s). 
#### Get Joke(s)
##### Filtering Jokes
The JokesAPI has versatile filtering options. There are three different filtering methods in JokeAPI:
- Joke Type
- Search string
- Joke Count

All of these filtering options are enforced by the following url query parameters to the `/jokes` endpoint:
- `?type`
- `?contains`
- `?count`

__Example Usage__
#### __Joke type filter__
These are all the available joke types: ` Misc, Programming, Dark, Pun, Spooky, Christmas`. To set the category you want, you need to parse it to the query parameter `?type`:

`?type=<Joke type>`

__Sample request__
```curl
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://0.0.0.0:6969/jokes/?type=pun' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```
__Sample response__
```json
[
  {
    "id": 8,
    "setup": "Thank you student loans for getting me through college.",
    "punchline": "I don't think I'll ever be able to repay you.",
    "type": "Pun"
  },
  {
    "id": 14,
    "setup": "What do you call a witch at the beach?",
    "punchline": "A Sandwich.",
    "type": "Pun"
  }
]
```
#### __Search string filter__
If a search string filter is used, only jokes that contain the specified string in either the `setup` or the `punchline` fields are returned. Parse the search string to the `?contains` query parameter as follows:

`?contains=<search string>`

__Sample request__
```curl
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://0.0.0.0:6969/jokes/?contains=psychiatrist' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```
__Sample response__
```json
[
  {
    "id": 10,
    "setup": "I told my psychiatrist I got suicidal tendencies.",
    "punchline": "He said from now on I have to pay in advance.",
    "type": "Dark"
  }
]
```

#### __Joke count filter__
This filter allows you to set a certain amount of jokes to receive in a single call to the `Get Joke` endpoint.You can set it using the `?count` URL parameter. JokesAPI defaults to the maximum (10) jokes per requests `0<number<=10`

`?count=<number>`

__Sample request__
```curl
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://0.0.0.0:6969/jokes/?count=5' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```
__Sample response__
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "setup": "How many programmers does it take to screw in a light bulb?",
    "punchline": "None. It's a hardware problem.",
    "type": "Programming"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "setup": "Why did the web developer walk out of a resturant in disgust?",
    "punchline": "The seating was laid out in tables.",
    "type": "Programming"
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "setup": "Why is 6 afraid of 7 in hexadecimal Canada?",
    "punchline": "Because 7 8 9 A?",
    "type": "Programming"
  },
  {
    "id": 4,
    "setup": "Programming is like sex.",
    "punchline": "Make one mistake and you end up supporting it for the rest of your life.",
    "type": "Programming"
  },
  {
    "id": 5,
    "setup": "Hey, wanna hear a joke?",
    "punchline": "Parsing HTML with regex.",
    "type": "Programming"
  }
]
```
#### __Applying multiple filters__
You can combine multiple filters by combining the query parameters. The parameters need to be prefixed by a single question mark (?) and separate key/value pairs need to be delimited from another by an ampersand (&). Keys are separated from values with an equals sign (=).

Example: `http://0.0.0.0:6969/jokes?type=programming&contains=program&count=2`

__Request__
```curl
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://0.0.0.0:6969/jokes/?count=2&type=programming&contains=program' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

__Sample response__
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "setup": "How many programmers does it take to screw in a light bulb?",
    "punchline": "None. It's a hardware problem.",
    "type": "Programming"
  },
  {
    "id": 4,
    "setup": "Programming is like sex.",
    "punchline": "Make one mistake and you end up supporting it for the rest of your life.",
    "type": "Programming"
  }
]
```

#### Getting a joke by id
```http
GET /jokes/<id>
```
__Sample request__
```curl
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://0.0.0.0:6969/jokes/1' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```
__Sample response__
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "setup": "How many programmers does it take to screw in a light bulb?",
  "punchline": "None. It's a hardware problem.",
  "type": "Programming"
}
```
